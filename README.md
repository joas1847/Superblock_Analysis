Code used in the paper [*Superilles de Barcelona: Una estimaci√≥ de l'impacte en la qualitat de vida urbana (2023)*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10hKnD4FSDqN-J4SZVnfhOSCi2sCOLPQ8/view), for wrangling the data and provide some preliminar statistical analysis along with some graphics.

Many cities across the world are currently working to develop new urban planning models that are both sustainable and efficient. Barcelona hopes to do this through its new idea, the Superilles.
Some of the primary features of this new proposal are lane reductions, road widening, and the placement of urban furniture.
This innovative project aims to reduce the number of cars on the road. This study uses a difference-in-differences model to assess the impact of several factors on traffic accidents in Barcelona.

Data sources for this project are the open source website of Barcelona's city council [Open Data BCN](https://opendata-ajuntament.barcelona.cat/es).
